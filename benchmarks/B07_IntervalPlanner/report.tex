\subsubsection{Benchmark 7 - Interval Planner} The provided Class is \texttt{IntervalPlanner} class with \texttt{IntervalPlannerTest} as its test-class.\\
\textbf{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{normalizeIntervals(List<int[]> raw)} - validates and normalizes interval endpoints (start <= end) and sorts them.
    \item \texttt{mergeIntervals(List<int[]> raw)} - merges overlapping or adjacent intervals.
    \texttt{invertWithinRange(...)} - computes free intervals within a day range given busy intervals.
    \texttt{totalDuration(List<int[]> intervals)} - sums durations of intervals.\\
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Bugfix}\\
The \texttt{mergeIntervals} method builds a \texttt{merged} list but mistakenly returns the original \texttt{intervals} list at the end. The fix is to return \texttt{merged} so that callers receive the merged result.
