\subsubsection{Benchmark 2 - Duplicate Line} The provided Class is \texttt{ArrayUtils} class with \texttt{ArrayUtilsTest} as its test-class.\\
\textbf{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{findIndexOf(int value, int... array)} - searches for the first index of a value in the array and returns -1 when absent.
    \item \texttt{countOccurrences(int value, int... array)} - counts how often a value occurs in the array. Contains bug: the counter is incremented twice for a matching element, leading to inflated counts.\\
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Bugfix}\\
The bug can be fixed by removing the duplicated increment (the second \texttt{count++}) so each matching element only increases the counter once.
