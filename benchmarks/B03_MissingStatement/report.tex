\subsubsection{Benchmark 3 - Missing Statement} The provided Class is \texttt{ListStreamUtils} class with \texttt{ListStreamUtilsTest} as its test-class.\\
\textbf{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{joinObjectsWithComma(Object... objects)} - joins objects into a single string separated by commas.
    \item \texttt{joinObjectsTwiceWithComma(Object... objects)} - joins the objects twice separated by commas.\\
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Bugfix}\\
The bug in \texttt{joinObjectsWithComma} is a missing append statement: the code mistakenly calls \texttt{System.out.println("Append here")} instead of appending a comma (e.g. \texttt{result.append(", ")}). Replacing the print call with the proper \texttt{append} fixes the joining behavior.
